# Codewars Monitor

This little project was made for fun, just for training some go code and entertain myself.

The idea is monitor your friends in codewars to know how they doing. Make a history.

If you have any tip or recommendation, feel free to open an issue.

## Requirements
* GO [install](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* MongoDB [install](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

if you want run with docker and docker-compose:
* Docker [install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* docker-compose [install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Run with docker
Inside codewars-watcher directory run:

``docker-compose build && docker-compose up``


## Todo
* Finish file store, to make optional mongodb;
* Better names to the watcher method;
