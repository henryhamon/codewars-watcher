# Codewars Monitor

This little project was made for fun, just for training some go code and entertain myself.

The idea is monitor your friends in codewars to know how they doing. Make a history.

## Requirements
* GO [install](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* MongoDB [install](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)


## Todo
* Finish file store, to make optional mongodb;
* Put into a package structure;
* Check http method better.
* Refactor api.go
